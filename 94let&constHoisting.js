// console.log(firstName);
let firstName = "Mamta";
console.log(firstName)

// 1st line will print error ReferenceError: Cannot access 'firstName' before initialization as let and const are stored in global memory but uninitialized. These are hoisted but can't be used before initialization. Here Initialization refers to the assignment of value to a let or const variable. Same goes with const in above code.
