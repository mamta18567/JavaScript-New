// We must use const for creating an array.
const fruits = ["Apple","Mango"];
fruits.push("Banana"); // this will not give any kinda error.

// If we try to do like this , then obv it will give error because we cant change const variables. Assignment to constant variable.

// fruits = ["kiwi", "orange"];
console.log(fruits);
